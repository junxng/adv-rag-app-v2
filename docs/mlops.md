# MLOps Documentation

This document outlines the MLOps practices and infrastructure implemented in the Advanced RAG Application.

## Overview

The MLOps infrastructure for this application is designed to ensure:

1. **Reliability**: Robust testing and monitoring
2. **Reproducibility**: Consistent environments and versioning
3. **Scalability**: Efficient resource utilization
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback loops for model improvement

## Components

### 1. Monitoring and Observability

#### Langfuse Integration

Langfuse is used for LLM observability, providing:

- Tracing for all LLM interactions
- Performance metrics (latency, token usage)
- Quality metrics (relevance scores, classification accuracy)
- User feedback collection

Key metrics tracked:

- **Classification Accuracy**: How accurately queries are classified
- **Retrieval Quality**: Relevance of retrieved documents
- **Response Quality**: User satisfaction with responses
- **Latency**: Response time for various components
- **Token Usage**: Consumption of tokens by model

#### Logging

The application uses structured logging with:

- JSON format for machine readability
- Different log levels for various environments
- Contextual information in logs

### 2. Testing Framework

The testing framework includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Testing complete user flows
- **Evaluation Tests**: Assessing model performance

Testing tools:

- **pytest**: For Python tests
- **moto**: For mocking AWS services
- **unittest.mock**: For mocking dependencies

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automates:

- Running tests on pull requests
- Building Docker images
- Deploying to staging/production environments

GitHub Actions workflow stages:

1. **Build**: Compile and package the application
2. **Test**: Run automated tests
3. **Analyze**: Static code analysis and security scanning
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to the appropriate environment

### 4. Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure is defined using:

- **Docker Compose**: For local development
- **Terraform**: For cloud infrastructure (AWS)

Key infrastructure components:

- **DynamoDB**: For structured data storage
- **S3**: For document storage
- **LocalStack**: For local AWS service simulation

### 5. Model Evaluation and Improvement

The application includes:

- **Feedback Collection**: User feedback on responses
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracking model performance
- **A/B Testing**: Testing different model configurations

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Running Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pytest tests/
   ```

3. **Deploying Changes**:
   - Create a pull request
   - CI pipeline runs tests
   - After approval, changes are merged
   - CD pipeline deploys to staging/production

## Monitoring Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard provides:

- Real-time metrics on system performance
- Historical trends for key metrics
- Alerts for critical issues

Access the dashboard at:
- Local: http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard
- Production: https://your-domain.com/admin/dashboard

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**:
   - Use feature branches
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Review code before merging

2. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for all new features
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Run tests locally before pushing

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Check dashboards regularly
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics
   - Investigate anomalies promptly

4. **Security**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Follow least privilege principle
   - Encrypt sensitive data

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Langfuse Connection Issues**:
   - Check API keys in environment variables
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check Langfuse service status

2. **AWS Service Errors**:
   - Verify AWS credentials
   - Check resource limits
   - Review IAM permissions

3. **Model Performance Degradation**:
   - Check for data drift
   - Review recent model changes
   - Analyze user feedback
