Key Features & Implementation
1. Query Classification (Routing Decision)
Uses LangChain Classifier to determine if the question is about account, troubleshooting, or general tech info.
Example:
"What is my last support ticket status?" → SQL Database
"How do I fix a slow laptop?" → Tavily Web Search
"What is the company’s remote work policy?" → VectorDB Retrieval

2. SQL Database Querying (For Account & Support History)
Uses LangChain SQL Database Toolkit to fetch user-specific data.
Example Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT status FROM support_tickets WHERE user_id = '12345' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
Response:
"Your latest support ticket is still being processed. Estimated resolution: 2 days."

3. Tavily Web Search (For External Troubleshooting & FAQs)
Uses Tavily API to fetch up-to-date troubleshooting guides.
Example:
User asks: "How do I fix my Windows 11 Wi-Fi issue?"
Chatbot searches Tavily and retrieves relevant forums, Microsoft support articles.
Response:
"Based on recent articles, try resetting your network adapter by running: netsh winsock reset."

4. VectorDB Context Retrieval (For Internal Docs & Policies)
Uses FAISS / Chroma / Pinecone to store company-specific knowledge base.
Example:
User asks: "What is the VPN setup process for remote employees?"
Chatbot retrieves the most relevant internal document excerpt.
Response:
"To set up VPN, download the company VPN client and log in using your SSO credentials. More details."

5. Chat History Management
Uses LangChain Memory to maintain conversation context.
Example:
User: "How do I access the employee portal?"
Chatbot: "Use your work email to log in at portal.company.com."
User: "I forgot my password."
Chatbot remembers context and provides password reset steps instead of asking for clarification.

6. Monitoring with LangSmith
Tracks query classification accuracy, retrieval effectiveness, and user interactions.
Example:
Logs which data source (SQL, Tavily, VectorDB) was used for each query.
Detects when search results are low-quality, prompting admin adjustments.

7. Frontend (Simple UI)
A React-based chatbot UI for user interaction.
Displays chatbot responses with citations (SQL, Tavily, or VectorDB).
